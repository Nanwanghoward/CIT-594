req:
a. Given a user u and item i, what is the system’s prediction for the user’s likely preference of that item?b. Given a user u and a threshold n, what are the n-highest predicted preferences for that user?





recommender sys: (2 focus)
1. predict task
given a user and an item, give a user’s likely preference


2.recommendation list
given a user, produce the best ranked list of n items for user’s need
trivial: n highest predicted item for the user’s need
non-trivial: predicted preference may not be the only criteria used to produce recommendation list

factor: 1. predicted preference, 2. recent watching history, 


(users, items, ratings)
rating type is unknown
rating matrix is composed of triples containing unknown rating value.










variable:
Iu:is the set of items rated or purchased by user u
Ui:is the set of users who have rated or purchased i
R: rating matrix
r(u,i):the rating user u provided for item i
ru:the vector of all ratings provided by user u
ri:the vector of all ratings provided by item i
ru ba: the average rating of a user u
ri ba: the average of an item i ratings

variance:
computing prediction:
1.formula
  #how many neighbors to select# (based on a similarity #threshold# or neighborhood size)
  threshold k pre choosing 20-50, and  easy to change later.
  
2.similarity function choosing


3.inserting new user and ratings



reference:
Collaborative filtering:
1. k-Nearest Neighbor collaborative filtering(user-user CF)
step one: 1. A similarity function s computing the similarity between two users.step two: 2. A method for using similarities and ratings to generate predictions.
